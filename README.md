# Hyperspectral-Image-Analysis-using-Machine-Learning-ML-and-Principal-Component-Analysis-PCA-
The project starts by loading a hyperspectral image (HSI) dataset, specifically the Pavia University dataset, along with its ground truth data. This dataset is represented in a multi-dimensional array where each pixel has a spectrum of data points across different wavelengths.
